          <h2 class="policy-terms-text">What Are Cookies</h2>
          <p class="policy-terms-text-one">
            Like almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which
            are small files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve
            your experience. This page explains what information they collect,
            how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We
            will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored,
            however this may downgrade or ‘break’ certain elements of the site’s
            functionality.
          </p>

          <h2 class="policy-terms-text">How We Use Cookies</h2>
          <p class="policy-terms-text-one">
            We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
            Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard options
            for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality
            and features they add to this site. If you are not sure whether you
            need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you
            use, it is recommended that you leave all cookies on.
          </p>

          <h2 class="policy-terms-text">Disabling Cookies</h2>
          <p class="policy-terms-text-one">
            You can prevent cookies from being set by adjusting the settings on
            your browser (see your browser Help section to find out how to do
            this). Please note that disabling cookies will affect the
            functionality of this and many other websites that you visit.
            Disabling cookies will usually result in certain functionality and
            features of this site being disabled. Therefore, it is recommended
            that you do not disable cookies.
          </p>

          <h2 class="policy-terms-text">Cookies We Set</h2>

          <p class="policy-terms-text-one">
            Site preferences cookies: In order to provide you with a great
            experience on this site, we provide the functionality to set your
            preferences for how this site works when you use it. In order to
            remember your preferences, we need to set cookies so that this
            information can be called when you interact with a page, which is
            affected by your preferences.
          </p>

          <h2 class="policy-terms-text text-bold">Third Party Cookies</h2>
          <p class="policy-terms-text-one">
            In some special cases, we also use cookies provided by trusted third
            parties. The following section explains in detail the third party
            cookies you may encounter through this site. <br />
            This site uses Google Analytics, one of the most widespread and
            trusted analytics solutions on the web, to help us understand how
            you use the site and how we can improve your experience. These
            cookies may track things like how long you spend on the site and the
            pages you visit, so that we can continue to produce engaging
            content. For more information about Google Analytics cookies, see
            the official Google Analytics page. <br />
            The Google AdSense service we use to serve ads uses a DoubleClick
            cookie to deliver more relevant ads across the web and to limit the
            number of times a given ad is shown to you. For more information
            about Google AdSense, see the official Google AdSense privacy FAQ .
          </p>
          <h2 class="policy-terms-text text-bold">More Information</h2>
          <p class="policy-terms-text-one">
            We hope this has clarified matters for you. As mentioned earlier, if
            there is something you are not sure whether you need or not, it is
            usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with
            one of the features you use on our site.
